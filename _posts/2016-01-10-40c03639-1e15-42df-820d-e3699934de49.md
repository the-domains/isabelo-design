_Brooklyn Native - Parsons

I've
been an Interior Designer for years now, with experience in high-end
residential with some commercial work. I bring an unconstrained and
inspired approach to everything I do. I develop innovative concepts and designs
for a client's home, furniture & lighting designs. I source and forage
after highly-sought after pieces and beautiful materials to produce new
finished products. I work with an amazing array of craftsmen and artisans
to create beautiful objects. I feel the best designers are those who are influenced
by the world around them, have an innate understanding of their customers'
aesthetic and specific design challenge, who find the opportunity to produce
work that is both contemporary and inventive, and who strive to have a small
footprint yet a big impact. That is the type of designer I aim to be with each
and every project I undertake.     ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecdde3ee-6713-4a6d-962f-8ad0dd9b7840.png)
